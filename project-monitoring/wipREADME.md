*************
EXCEL
Deprecated. There were macros for recording historical data, more user friendly formatting.

Data attributes are not fully normalized!
PROJECT OVERVIEW
Reason for "Portfolio evolution": Projects are constantly comming up, so we need to see if we are starting more than we are able to execute.

PROJCTES IN PROGRESS
Would ideally insert Gantt or Evolução Física, but Gantt is for paid version, and the second one requires a historical record of actionlog.
DATEDIFF to calculate duration of actions.
Time taken will be big for 'in progress' as it counts TODAY as the date for calculation of uncompleted actions.
